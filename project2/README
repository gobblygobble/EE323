EE323 Computer Network Assignment 2
20160609 정진하

1. Because of stack overflow, before executing my code, please type the following command in linux terminal:
"ulimit -s unlimited"

2. When checking with FireFox, I noticed that in addition to changing proxy behaviors as taught in class, my browser should also turn off "gzip encoding" in FireFox to make it work properly.

3. It seems that for some reason the page of warning.or.kr won't be displayed when testing blacklist functionalities with FireFox.
But when I print out the messages sent between client-proxy-server, they display proper messages.
To enable this (and check), there are four fprintf(stdout, "step #: %s", ...) lines each being step 1, step 2, step 3, and step 4. These lines need to be un-commented.

4. Also, I have included a header file proxy.h.

5. The function error_message() was made for debugging purposes. It may seem like it prints messages, but in the function implementation, it does nothing. It simply enters and exits.

I'd also like to use two tokens for this assignment.
Thank you.
